## Chaos Engineering Recommendations

Based on this load test, consider these chaos experiments:

1. **Service Isolation:** Test behavior when individual services fail
2. **Network Partitions:** Verify graceful degradation during network issues
3. **Resource Constraints:** Test performance under memory/CPU pressure
4. **Database Failures:** Simulate data store unavailability
5. **Latency Injection:** Test timeout handling and retry mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Analyze the JSON results to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Review error patterns during chaos experiments
3. Adjust service timeouts and retry policies based on findings
4. Implement circuit breakers where needed
5. Set up monitoring and alerting based on observed thresholds
