1. Ingress Controller Installation
   - Installed NGINX Ingress Controller in Minikube to handle Ingress resources.
   - Verified installation with:
     kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

2. Service & Deployment Setup
   - Each microservice (user-service, order-service, payment-service) deployed with:
     - Deployment
     - Service of type ClusterIP
   - Exposed ports:
     - user-service: 3001
     - order-service: 3002
     - payment-service: 3003

3. Ingress Resource Configuration
   - Created 'microservices-ingress' with:
     Host: microservices.local
     Paths:
       /users   -> user-service port 3001
       /orders  -> order-service port 3002
       /payment -> payment-service port 3003
     - pathType: Prefix
     - Annotation:
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

4. Host Resolution
   - Added microservices.local to /etc/hosts pointing to Minikube IP:
     minikube ip
     sudo nano /etc/hosts
     <MINIKUBE_IP> microservices.local

5. Testing
   - Apply ingress:
     kubectl apply -f ingress-setup.yaml
   - Verify and test:
     kubectl get ingress
     curl http://microservices.local/users
     curl http://microservices.local/orders
     curl http://microservices.local/payment

Description:
The NGINX ingress takes incoming requests for microservices.local and routes them internally to the correct service based on the URL path.
